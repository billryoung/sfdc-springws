=====================

Example codebase to use Spring Web Services to call the Salesforce REST API.  My goal isn't a utility JAR.  My goal is a example code that can help someone understand the general concept and apply to their specific circumstance.

The spring boot application has a command line runner that logs into Salesforce and runs a simple query against Account.  In this stock example, credentials for login are sourced from application.properties.
